Scraping Financial data from a financial services website

We need the data to create a financial model to target financial agents for research and marketing purposes in terms of data analytics.
The data can be used in different vertical use cases. A startup founder friend needed the data for his motor vehicle data analytics project. This data can be used for Upartna in terms of finding the right financial services provider for property insurance or loans funding projects that can be onboarded on our construction marketplace platform.
